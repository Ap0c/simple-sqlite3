# Simple Sqlite3

A simple way of interacting with sqlite3 in Python, designed for use in web apps.

## What/Why?

This is not meant to be a sophisticated or comprehensive library for interacting with sqlite3. I found that I was reusing this code enough when working with flask and bottle that it made sense to turn it into a standalone package.
