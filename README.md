# Simple Sqlite3

A simple library for interacting with sqlite3 in Python, designed for use in web apps.

## What/Why?

I found that I was reusing this code enough when working with flask and bottle that it made sense to turn it into a standalone package. This is not meant to be a comprehensive library for interacting with sqlite3, it's simply meant to streamline the process.
